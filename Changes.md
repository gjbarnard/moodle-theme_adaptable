Change Log in version 403.1.5 (2023111806)
===========================================
1. Reduce drawer flicker on page load when the navbar is sticky.
2. Fix 'itemid' not being regenerated for 'customjsfiles'.
3. Add ability to move custom menus into a single menu to save navbar space by giving 'custommenutitle' setting a value.
   Note: At bottom of the 'Navbar' settings tab.
4. Improve custom menu code to facilitate simple inclusion of Font Awesome icons.
5. Fix dropdown menu id's.
6. Remember the tab currently selected when saving settings.
7. Functionality using a 'custom menu' such as 'Custom menu items', 'Header menus' and 'Tools menu' now supports the
   following format:
    text|url|title|langs|fontawesome classes or name|capability.
   where:
     text - Text to show for the entry.
     url - URL of the entry.
     title - Title attribute in the link tag value.
     langs - Only show on the given language codes - separate more than one with a comma.
     fontawesome classes or name - State the Font Awesome classes or name for the icon that is placed before the text.
     capability - State the capability to check that the user has on the page before showing, for example
       'moodle/course:manageactivities' to only show to editing teachers.
8. Renamed 'Tools menu dropdown' setting tab to 'Tools menu'.
9. Add 'customusermenuitems' to the user menu.
10. Add FontAwesome support to 'customusermenuitems' as the third parameter, name or CSS classes.
11. Add duplicate entries for 'custommenuitems' and 'customusermenuitems' on a new 'Custom menu' settings tab.
12. Settings language strings tidy.
13. Social icons improvement to use either icon name or CSS classes.
14. Replace 'menuhovercolor' with 'menubkhovercolor' and 'menufonthovercolor' to fix menu hovering.
15. Add 'courseindexenabled' setting on the 'Course index' tab to enable / disable the 'Course Index'.
16. Fix header information overridden when set in the context header leading to missing output.
17. Add 'Information blocks'.  This is designed to be a replacement for the marketing blocks that are
    now deprecated.  The code that they use has always been problematic and subject to contained file
    based content being lost on occasion, or rather not lost but misplaced in terms of linkage at times.
    I've never been able to entirely rectify or resolve the issues.  Therefore instead of reinventing the
    wheel, I've gone for a block region based solution whereby proven and tested block code is employed.
    Instead of defining the content in the theme settings, you'll create blocks and place them in the
    'information' region on the front page.  Of course you'll find all of the other settings in place
    to control the layout and visiblity as before, on the theme's 'Information blocks' settings tab.
    When editing you'll see the full block header with each block having the same width to allow easy
    manipulation, i.e. the layout you set is not applied.  Its only when editing is off that the layout
    is applied and the block titles removed.  If you see the word 'Overflow' then that means that you have
    more blocks than you've defined in the layout rows to allow.  Admins will see 'Marketing blocks are
    deprecated, please migrate to using the Information block region.'.  When editing, block regions will
    have their name at the top.  In testing with re-ordering the blocks I did find this problematic and
    could not work out entiry why as the theme code is doing what it should do, the core code is telling
    the backend via an AJAX call about the reordering, just that after doing so then it seemed that cron
    had to run for the changes to become permanent.  It is my intention that other settings employing the
    same code as the marketing blocks will also migrate to this improved solution.
18. Improve the look of the calendar block controls and fix the next and previous icons.
19. Improve the layout builder to have new clearer responsive images.

Change Log in version 403.1.4 (2023111805)
===========================================
1. New setting 'mobileprimarynav' to control the display of the mobile primary navigation.  This is found on the
   'Header' tab in the theme settings.
2. New setting 'customjsfiles' to allow the addition of one or more JavaScript files to be included before 'customjs'
   is output to the page.  Sponsors only functionality.
3. Fix 'ORPHANED BLOCK - Originally displays in: Course page', ref: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=456522.
4. Apply 'MDL-72923 message: Fixed levels of headings in messaging drawer'.

   with any 'script' tags removed.

===========================================
1. Put the course title back in the header.
2. New setting 'headertitle' replaces 'sitetitle'.

4. New setting 'responsiveheadertitle' replaces 'responsivecoursetitle' / 'responsivesitetitle'.
5. New setting 'coursepageheaderhidetitle' replaces 'coursepageheaderhidesitetitle'.
6. Fix 'Wrong context for theme_adaptable/savediscard'.
7. Remove call to 'context_header' so that the course title is not duplicated on the page.
8. Improved header logic.  On a course page then if the course title is set to show 'enablecoursetitle' then it is
   shown with the 'categoryheadercustomtitleX' if there is one.  If not then the site title will show if 'sitetitle'
   is set and with 'categoryheadercustomtitleX' if there is one.  On a site page, then just the 'sitetitle' logic.
9. Fix 'Module menu delete item hover colour'.

Change Log in version 403.1.0 (2023111801)

7. Move the 'Alerts', 'Category Headers', 'Login', 'My courses', 'News ticker', 'Tools menu', 'Tracking' and 'User profile'
   functionality to a separate 'Local Adaptable' plugin that will be available to sponsors only.  This has been an
   extremely difficult decision to make, however with the continued lack of support I consider that I have been
   left with no choice and thus have targetted functionality unlikely to be used by small installations.

1. Fix 'My courses' page not rendering - ref: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=434718.
2. Fix undefined property $gradeediting.
3. Fix header two colour issues / icon padding - ref: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=434655#p1750208.  This means that
   the setting 'headertextcolor2' as been removed, such that 'headertextcolor' will now operate on both styles for the non-navbar
   portion of the header.  The CSS 'above-header' has been changed from an identifier to a class for this to bring even more
   consistency.  A new identifier 'header1' as been created, just as there is an existing 'header2'.
4. Fix 'course format plugins not working' - #277.  Note: This only removes code that prevents operation due to core API changes.
5. Fix 'Login page' - ref: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=435248.

Change Log in version 4.0.0.1 (2022051200)
===========================================
1. Removed 'coursesectionactivityuseadaptableicons' setting as M4.0 course format API prevents it having an effect.
2. Course format API changes remove use of 'print_single_section_page' method.
3. Fix user picture size.
4. The M4.0 course format API prevents themes from overriding section and module output, this is now the full responsibility of the
   course format.  The consequence of this means that the activity information code can no longer be called and used.  The tracker
   issue MDL-73679 is an 'entry point' for understanding all of this and how course formats can override the output, but as
   'get_output_classname()' in '/course/format/classes/base.php' only allows 'overriding' of the rendering classes for course
   formats, then this is the 'why', whereas this sort of thing used to be in the core course renderer which the course format used
   and could be overridden by the theme and the course format use that instance.
5. Refactor broken footer logic.
6. Fix missing debug information.
7. Fix navbar search styling.
8. No edit switch.
9. Fix button font family - #276.
10. Fix no assignment instructions - ref: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=434427#p1748150.
11. Fix 'icon -> monologo' and menu spacing.
12. Fix navbar cog down arrow icon.
13. Remove double usage of 'icon' class on the 'This course' menu.
14. Add 'unaddableblocks' setting that core code uses.
15. State that the theme does not use the 'Course index'.
16. Fix 'btn-icon' position - e.g. course 'Edit' on sections / modules.
17. Activity styling.

Change Log in version 3.11.1.2 (2021081007)

Known issues with this version
------------------------------
1. Database activity information does not show.
2. Virtual Programming Labs run button will not stop spinning until page refreshed.
3. If you have the Calendar block shown on any given page but it actually isn't displayed to the user because the block region it is in
is not shown, then you may get an 'invalidparameter' error.  The workaround is to either ensure that the block is in a region that
is shown to all users or to remove the block from the page(s) where this happens.
4. Also look at '[Adaptable issues](https://gitlab.com/jezhops/moodle-theme_adaptable/-/issues)'.

Change Log in version 3.11.1.0 (2021081005)
===========================================
1. Fix 'Title under logo', please resave the 'Layout responsive' settings 'responsivelogo' and 'responsivecoursetitle' -
   Ref: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=431105.
2. Fix 'One Topic font color change not getting applied' - #264.
3. Add 'OneTopic active tab colour' - #269.
4. Disable database activity information as the SQL query does not work, needs fixing.
5. This major branch now stable.
6. Fix 'Empty settings including '0' ignored in css' - #260.
7. Fix activity border settings.
8. Add 'googlefonts' setting.  Note: It is essential that you review the implications of this setting.

Change Log in version 3.11.0.5(2021081004)
===========================================
1. Add new 'frontpageuserblocksenabled' setting to the 'Block settings' tab, ref: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=430124.
   Thus for guests and authenticated users, when 'un-ticked' then the 'side-post' region does not show on the front page, but it
   does for site admins.  When 'ticked' then 'side-post' will show for all and have content when there is some.
2. Fix 'No middle region'.
3. Tidied 'get_block_regions()' with the creation of the 'adaptable-block-area' style.
4. Fix 'Event observer code for activity information missing', pertains to code changes in 3.11.0.4.
5. Fix 'Implications of MDL-70721 output: Remove redundant title'.

Change Log in version 3.11.0.4 (2021081003)
===========================================
1. Re-fix 'Title moved to top by search', ref: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=425729#p1718073.
2. Fix 'block configuration actions menu does not contrast enough', ref: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=427627.
3. Fix 'My Courses dropdown not showing all enrolled courses' - #258.
4. Fix "My courses dropdown can show hidden courses when user does not have capability when 'mysitessortoverride' setting is not
   set to 'Use list from my overview'", related to #258.
5. Makes sense to have the logo as a link to the frontpage when there is no navbar.
6. Added 'enableadditionalmoddata' setting to turn on / off additional information at a site level.  Default is 'off'!
7. Added 'courseadditionalmoddatamaxstudents' setting to restrict, if desired, the display of the activity information on a
   a course of the number of students on that course exceeds it.  When 'enableadditionalmoddata' is enabled, then
   additional information about the status of this is shown at the top of the course when editing.  This is so
   that large courses can be automatically prevented from showing the information as the calculations would take an
   unacceptable amount of time to compute.  It is up to the administrator to set the figure based upon benchmarking / testing
   of the performance characteristics of the server.  The default is '0', which means 'unlimited' number of students.
8. Fixed 'ct' to 'ad' class prefixes for activity info in the course renderer.

Change Log in version 3.11.0.3 (2021081002)
===========================================

3. Change SCSS comments from CSS to SCSS ones so that they are not in the 'all' file sent to the browser and hence it will be smaller.
4. Fix dialog text colour, i.e. adding a new question to a quiz.
5. Fix 'Title moved to top by search', ref: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=425729#p1718073.

Change Log in version 3.11.0.2 (2021081001)

4. Remove redundant navbar toggler and tidy the CSS.
5. Further CSS tidy and refactor some to SCSS.

7. Added extra information in the settings tabs about maturity of the release.
8. Fix 'Userdata cache not used' - #247.

6. Added upgrade script to change settings with '0px' to '0' for upgrades that don't have "No such thing as '0px'" change.
   Thus, when they do, the setting will be changed correctly instead of getting a default and effectively changing the
   value of the setting.
7. README.md to Readme.md - #240.

HTML/CSS sample code for block areas
------------------------------------
Here you will find some code samples to help you to customize the Info Box and the Marketing Blocks.

You can insert any HTML tag to customize the front page blocks. Use a 'div' tag as a main container and add the height to keep the
same value in all the blocks.

The Font Awesome icons set is available in
http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/.

You can insert any of them following the examples
http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/


Front Page Slider Styles
------------------------
Add images with at least 1900px x 400px.
If you want to reduce or increase the height, Adaptable will resize the image automatically.
There are two possible slider styles each with different markup required:


Original BCU Slider Markup:
````
<div class="span9">
  <h4>Information</h4>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore
    et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip
    ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
  </div>

  <div class="span3">
  <a href="#" class="submit">2016/17 Courses <i class="fa-chevron-right fa"></i></a>
</div>
````


Coventry Style Slider Markup
````
<div class="span6 col-sm-6">
<h3>Hand-crafted</h3> <h4>pixels and code for the Moodle community</h4>
<a href="#" class="submit">Check out our custom theme pricing!</a>
</div>
````

Frontpage Marketing Block HTML structure Coventry
````
<div><img src="http://somewebsite.com/2.jpg" class="marketimage"></div>
<h4><a href="#">International Courses</a></h4>
<p>Some text below the link....</p>
````

Front page Info Box and Marketing Blocks
----------------------------------------

There are two Info blocks in the front page located above and below the Marketing Blocks. These are just for compatibility with the
old BCU.

It is recommended to use the new marketing blocks builder that allows you to create your own layout and add much more blocks.

There are 8 rows where you can add up to 4 blocks in each with a total of 32 block of different size. See pix/layout.png for
more information.

You can enter any HTML code to the block, include FA icons, images, videos and apply in-line styles.

Some samples:


Block with solid background, FA icon and some text:
````
<div style="text-align:center; background: #e6e6e6; height: 350px; padding: 7px;">
    <i class="fa fa-paint-brush fa-5x" style="color: #3A454b;"></i>
    <h3>Title </h3>

</div>
````

      <span class="multilang" lang="ca">text en catalÃƒ </span>
</div>

-----------
From version 1.3 the news ticker do not need to create an unordered list. Just add paragraphs using 'p' tags:
````
<p>Configure all the theme colors</p>
<p>Use any Google Font for the content, headings and site title</p>
<p>Display a logo or a configurable title site</p>
<p>Configurable Slideshow</p>
<p>Display up to 12 marketing blocks in the front page</p>
````

Messages / Notifications
------------------------
Moodle 3.2 includes a new system to display messages and notifications in the screen.

The new system displays a hard coded black icons that are difficult to see when using dark background color in the top header.
In that case, you can use an alternate icons pack using white color.

Login the server by FTP or SFTP and open /theme/adaptable/pix_core/i and
delete notifications.png and rename notifications-white.png to notifications.png

Then open /theme/adaptable/pix_core/t and delete message.png and
rename message-white.png to message.png

From moodle 3.6 the messages and notifications has been changed to the called "Messages Drawer".


Activities icons
------------------------
From version 1.4, Adaptable includes its own icons pack that replace the default moodle icons.
If you don't want to use the icons just remove adaptable/pix_plugins and adaptable/pix_core/f
You can enable this icons from the administration.
