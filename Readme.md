Adaptable - the most adaptable Moodle theme
===========================================
Adaptable is a highly customisable responsive Moodle theme:

- Additional customisable information / marketing blocks.
- Additional header navigation.
- Additional layout settings.
- Alternative frontpage course styles.
- Alternative slider.
- Course tabbed layout builder.
- Custom category headers (Sponsors only functionality).
- Custom frontpage courses list.
- Customisable fonts (Google Fonts).
- Customisable login page (Sponsors only functionality).
- Customisable navigation bar.
- Dashboard layout builder.
- Dismissible bootstrap alerts (Sponsors only functionality).
- Footer block layout builder.
- Forum post email template override.
- Frontpage layout builder.
- Fully customisable colours.
- Fully customisable block styles (including Font Awesome icons).
- Fully customisable buttons.
- My courses menu (Sponsors only functionality).
- News ticker (Sponsors only functionality).
- Print settings.
- Privacy API.
- Responsive layout options.
- Social icons.
- Tools menus (Sponsors only functionality).
- Two and three row header style options.
- User favourites menu - per user (Sponsors only functionality).
- User profile options.

In addition many fields (menus, news items, alerts and help links) can be targeted using custom profile fields, thus it is possible
to present different users with different navigation items and notices.  It is also possible for individual users to customize where
they want top menu navigation to appear (disable, home pages only, site wide) using custom profile fields.

Adaptable has a lot of settings and may seem daunting at first, my advice is to simply install with the default settings and play
with it afterwards.

With a little time you should be able to setup an attractive Moodle site with a high degree of individuality without without
knowing any CSS.
